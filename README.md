### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
In this project, I built a website that helps the user remind themselves of their inherent value through the display of mantras and affirmations. The user has the ability to choose wether they want to hear a mantra or affirmation, and upon choosing, click a "Receive Message" button that then displays a random message in their topic of choice. They will be able to see every message once without repeating, until the messages run out. The user then gets notified that they will begin to see repeated messages, and if they choose they can continue seeing messages. This can continue in an infinite loop. They can also switch to the other category and begin to see messages from that prompt in the same manner.

### Installation Instructions:

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
I was given six days to complete this project, and I took about 5 days to complete. I'm in Mod 1 of the Turing program.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain experience building an application.
Write HTML, CSS and JavaScript to accomplish the prompts in the provided comp.

- Understand how to listen and respond to user events.

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)
**Wins**
1. I deepened my understanding of arrays and how to use them together with if statements in my functions. 
2. I got more experience writing dynamic code. 

**Challenges**
1. The most challenging part of the project for me was getting the app to not only show each message just once, but let the user know they've reached the end of the messages before continuing to display messages upon clicking the message button. 
2. Git Flow is still proving to be ticky for me, but I noticed an improvement from the project I worked on last week. 
3. Initially had some trouble working with two different arrays and tying the main, "Receive Message" button to two radio buttons, specifically when reaching the CYOA part of the project.
